We provide access to the dataset of experiments conducted in our work "Experimental Analysis of the Efficiency of Shared Access in IEEE802.15.4-TSCH Networks with Sporadic Traffic". S.Ben yaala , F.Theoleyre , R .Bouallegue. (to appear AINA 2018)

We model different inter-burst values and  scheduling functions. Measurements are set in .ods files. Since we consider series of measures for each configuration, we present them in the different spreadsheets. Then we plot 95% confidence intervals.

The title of each file lists the different parameters used in our experiments (scheduling function,number of nodes and the inter-burst duration). For exemple, we report in file fixed-fivenodes-200OFF.odv statistics  for five nodes that execute a hard shedule. The mean inter burst duration is equal to 200. File SF0-fivenodes-200OFF.odv reports statictics for five nodes configured to let SF0 scheduling function decide the number of shared cells to use. 

The validation of the exponential distribution (fig6) is reported in file expon.txt that describes the duration of each inter burst (Dinterburst) for lambda=0.001.

Log files and delay distribtions used in Fig8.a and Fig8.b are also provided.
